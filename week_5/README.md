## Week 5 Homework 

In this homework we'll put what we learned about Spark in practice.

For this homework we will be using the FHVHV 2021-06 data found here. [FHVHV Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/fhvhv/fhvhv_tripdata_2021-06.csv.gz )


### Question 1: 

**Install Spark and PySpark** 

- Install Spark
- Run PySpark
- Create a local spark session
- Execute spark.version.

What's the output?

result: after using `spark.version` in the notebooks is '3.3.1'


### Question 2: 

**HVFHW June 2021**

Read it with Spark using the same schema as we did in the lessons.</br> 
We will use this dataset for all the remaining questions.</br>
Repartition it to 12 partitions and save it to parquet.</br>
What is the average size of the Parquet (ending with .parquet extension) Files that were created (in MB)? Select the answer which most closely matches.</br>

- 24MB

result: 23 MB


### Question 3: 

**Count records**  

How many taxi trips were there on June 15?</br></br>

- 4040

result: localhost:4040

### Question 6: 

**Most frequent pickup location zone**

Load the zone lookup data into a temp view in Spark</br>
[Zone Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv)</br>

Using the zone lookup data and the fhvhv June 2021 data, what is the name of the most frequent pickup location zone?</br>
